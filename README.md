# 🌊 ProteOS (P/OS)

> *"Shape-shifting intelligence from the depths of containerization"*

**ProteOS** — derived from **Proteus (Πρωτεύς)**, the Greek sea god of shape-shifting, wisdom, and prophecy. Just as Proteus could transform into any form, ProteOS adapts seamlessly between multiple AI providers, embodying flexibility and intelligence while maintaining Docker's oceanic heritage.
