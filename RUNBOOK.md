# ProteOS — Full-stack runbook (Phase 2 acceptance)

How to run the complete Phase 2 stack and check off the acceptance criteria in
`plans/proteos-poc-to-prod.md`. This completes Task 2.8 ("run the full stack on
the Proxmox VM").

It is written to be **reproducible by someone else on different machines** —
every host-specific value is an env var with an `.env.example`, and the only
manual host step (the KVM VM) is the one already documented in
`spike/firecracker/00-proxmox-vm.md`.

## Topology

Two machines:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ App VM (any Docker host)  │         │ KVM host = Proxmox VM (nested KVM)    │
│                           │  HTTP   │                                      │
│  docker compose:          │  :9090  │  native (root) systemd service:      │
│   postgres                │ ──────► │   proteos-node-agent                 │
│   controlplane  ──────────┼─────────┤   (Firecracker driver)               │
│   web (nginx + SPA)       │ bearer  │     └─ jailer ► microVMs (guests)    │
│   browser ⇒ :8080         │  token  │                                      │
└───────────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- The **node-agent cannot be containerised** — it needs `/dev/kvm`, root, tap
  devices, the jailer, and host nftables. It runs natively on the KVM host.
- Everything else (Postgres, control plane, web) is portable and ships as a
  Docker Compose stack on the **app VM**.
- The control plane dials the agent **only** (plan decision #2), authenticated
  by a shared bearer token. Status flows back via the control plane's poller.
- The browser talks to one origin (the `web` nginx); nginx serves the SPA and
  reverse-proxies `/api` to the control plane so cookies + CSRF work.

Artifacts: `deploy/node-agent/` (KVM host) and `deploy/app-stack/` (app VM).

> Can both run on the **same** Proxmox VM? Yes — run the node-agent natively and
> the compose stack on the same box; set `PROTEOS_NODE_AGENT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:9090`
> and uncomment `extra_hosts` in `compose.yml`. The two-VM split below is the
> documented path.

---

## Part A — node-agent on the KVM host

Prereqs: the Firecracker spike has been run on this VM (`spike/firecracker/01-host-setup.sh`),
so `/dev/kvm` works and the pinned `firecracker`+`jailer` binaries exist under
`~/fc-spike/bin`. Go is installed (you already ran the `-tags=firecracker` tests).

### A1. Stage the pinned images

The driver resolves `kernel_ref`/`rootfs_ref` as filenames under the images dir
(`filepath.Join(ImagesDir, ref)`), and makes a fresh writable rootfs copy per
boot — so the base files stay pristine. Reuse the spike artifacts:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/proteos/images /srv/jailer
sudo cp ~/fc-spike/images/vmlinux           /var/lib/proteos/images/vmlinux
sudo cp ~/fc-spike/images/ubuntu-24.04.ext4 /var/lib/proteos/images/ubuntu-24.04.ext4
```

### A2. Point the agent at the firecracker/jailer binaries

The spike leaves them in `~/fc-spike/bin`. Either copy them to `/usr/local/bin`
(the defaults), or set `PROTEOS_FIRECRACKER_BIN`/`PROTEOS_JAILER_BIN` in the env
file. Copying is cleaner for a service:

```bash
sudo cp ~/fc-spike/bin/firecracker ~/fc-spike/bin/jailer /usr/local/bin/
```

### A3. Configure + run

```bash
cd <repo>/deploy/node-agent
cp .env.example .env
# set PROTEOS_AGENT_TOKEN (openssl rand -hex 32 — save it, the app VM needs it)
# confirm the paths and PROTEOS_AGENT_SUBNET
$EDITOR .env

sudo ./run-node-agent.sh        # preflight, build (-tags=firecracker), run foreground
```

Preflight prints `[ ok ]` for kvm/firecracker/jailer/ip/nft/images, or `[fail]`
with the exact missing thing. From another shell:

```bash
curl -s 127.0.0.1:9090/healthz   # {"status":"ok"}
```

### A4. (Recommended) Run it as a service

Persist across reboots and capture logs — see the install block at the top of
`deploy/node-agent/proteos-node-agent.service`. In short: build the binary once
(`run-node-agent.sh build`), put the env file at `/etc/proteos/node-agent.env`,
install + `systemctl enable --now proteos-node-agent`, then
`journalctl -u proteos-node-agent -f`.

### A5. Open the port to the app VM only

The agent listens on `0.0.0.0:9090`; the bearer token authenticates callers, but
still scope it at the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <APP_VM_IP> to any port 9090 proto tcp   # example
```

---

## Part B — app stack on the app VM

Prereq: Docker + Docker Compose v2. Clone the repo (or copy `deploy/app-stack/`
plus the `controlplane/`, `nodeagent/`, `web/`, `go.work*` trees the images
build from).

### B1. GitHub App callback

In your GitHub App (the Phase 1 one), set the user-authorization callback URL to:

```
http://<APP_VM_IP>:<WEB_PORT>/api/auth/github/callback
```

This must match `PROTEOS_BASE_URL` below exactly.

### B2. Configure

```bash
cd <repo>/deploy/app-stack
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Set, at minimum:
- `WEB_PORT` + `PROTEOS_BASE_URL` — the browser origin (e.g. `http://10.0.0.5:8080`).
- `PROTEOS_NODE_AGENT_URL` — `http://<KVM_HOST_IP>:9090`.
- `PROTEOS_AGENT_TOKEN` — **the same token** you set in Part A3.
- `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` / `PROTEOS_STATE_KEY` (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
- Keep `PROTEOS_KERNEL_REF` / `PROTEOS_ROOTFS_REF` matching the staged filenames.

### B3. Build + run

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f controlplane   # "applying migrations" then listening on :8080
```

The control plane applies migration `000002` on startup (`-migrate`), upserts the
host row from `PROTEOS_HOST_NAME` + `PROTEOS_NODE_AGENT_URL`, and starts the
poller. Confirm it reached the agent:

```bash
docker compose exec controlplane /usr/local/bin/controlplane --help >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
# from the app VM:
curl -s http://<KVM_HOST_IP>:9090/healthz   # reachable across the LAN?
```

### B4. Sign in

Open `PROTEOS_BASE_URL` in a browser → "Sign in with GitHub" → you land on the
Dashboard with a machine card (no machine yet).

## Part C — Phase 2 acceptance walkthrough

Tick each row of the Phase 2 checklist in `plans/proteos-poc-to-prod.md`.

1. **Create → provisioning → running (real FC VM).** Click **Create**. The card
   goes `provisioning → running` live over SSE (no refresh). On the KVM host:
   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep -i firecracker        # VMM running under a per-VM uid (>=100000)
   ls /srv/jailer/firecracker/         # one jail per machine
   sudo ip link | grep tap             # a tap device exists
   ```

2. **Every VMM is jailed.** The firecracker process runs as the dropped uid in a
   chroot — confirm the uid in `ps` is in the configured jail range, not 0.

3. **stop / start transitions persisted + one event row each.** Use the card's
   Stop then Start. Then:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U proteos -d proteos \
     -c "select from_state, to_state, type, actor from machine_events order by id;"
   ```
   Expect rows for each transition (`requested→provisioning→running→stopping→stopped→starting→running`).

4. **tap + private IP; vm_handle/host recorded.**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U proteos -d proteos \
     -c "select state, host_id, vm_handle, guest_ip from machines;"
   ```
   `guest_ip` populated, `vm_handle` set, `host_id` points at the seeded host.

5. **Dashboard live state + event stream.** Open the browser devtools Network
   tab → `GET /api/machine/events` stays open (SSE), and a second tab's
   Stop/Start updates the first without refresh.

6. **Basic default-deny egress (the decisive check).** Get a shell in a guest
   (via its tap/`guest_ip`, the spike's `03-network.sh` scheme), then:
   ```bash
   # inside the guest:
   curl --max-time 3 http://<gateway .1>:9090/healthz   # node-agent  -> MUST fail/time out
   curl --max-time 3 http://<KVM_HOST_IP>:9090/healthz  # agent (host)-> MUST fail
   curl --max-time 3 http://<APP_VM_IP>:8080/           # control plane -> MUST fail
   curl --max-time 3 https://1.1.1.1                    # internet    -> MUST succeed
   ```
   This exercises both nft hooks: the **input** chain drops guest→host-local
   services (the gateway IP, where the node-agent listens — the forward chain
   never sees host-destined traffic, so this must be blocked at `input`); the
   **forward** chain drops guest→RFC1918/link-local and NATs everything else to
   the internet.

   **If a check is wrong, diagnose with the per-rule counters** (on the KVM host,
   while re-running the guest curl):
   ```bash
   sudo nft list table ip proteos          # which rules' counters increment?
   sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward              # must be 1 for the internet path
   sudo conntrack -L | grep <guest_ip>     # is the connection NATed (src rewritten to the host)?
   ip route get 1.1.1.1                     # the host itself must reach the internet
   sudo nft list ruleset | grep -iE 'hook forward|policy drop'   # a competing table (docker/ufw/firewalld) dropping forward?
   ```
   Reading the counters for a guest→`1.1.1.1` attempt:
   - `forward … iifname <tap> oifname <egress> accept` **and** the `postrouting …
     masquerade` counters both climb, but no reply → return path / an upstream
     firewall is dropping the masqueraded traffic.
   - the `forward … accept` counter does **not** climb → packets aren't being
     forwarded: `ip_forward=0`, a competing `forward` chain with `policy drop`
     (Docker/ufw/firewalld on the KVM host), or a routing problem.
   - `masquerade` doesn't climb but `forward accept` does → NAT not applied
     (egress interface mismatch); confirm `egress` matches `ip route get 1.1.1.1`.

   > After deploying a node-agent fix, **existing machines keep their old rules**
   > (rules are written at boot). Destroy/recreate the machine, or stop+start it,
   > to pick up the new ruleset.

7. **Authenticated agent channel.** Temporarily blank/!wrong-token a control-plane
   restart → agent calls 401 and machines go to `error` with reason; restore the
   token to recover.

8. **Driver interface + pinned kernel/rootfs on the machine record.**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U proteos -d proteos \
     -c "select kernel_ref, rootfs_ref, resource_spec from machines;"
   ```

## Reproducibility notes

- **Pinned versions** live in `spike/firecracker/env.sh` + the committed
  `versions.lock`; firecracker/jailer/kernel/rootfs come from there.
- **A fresh person needs**: (1) a Proxmox VM per `00-proxmox-vm.md` + the spike's
  `01-host-setup.sh`; (2) any Docker host for the app stack; (3) the two
  `.env.example` files filled in with a shared token and matching image refs.
- **No host-specific paths are baked into code** — they are all env vars with
  documented defaults.
- **Clean slate** before a run: `spike/firecracker/07-teardown.sh` clears stale
  taps/nft rules; `docker compose down -v` drops the app stack + DB.

## Gotchas

- The agent's `PROTEOS_AGENT_SUBNET` (`172.30.0.0/24`) must not collide with the
  Proxmox bridge or the app VM subnet.
- `PROTEOS_BASE_URL`, `WEB_PORT`, and the GitHub callback URL must all agree, or
  OAuth fails with a redirect-uri mismatch.
- Containers can't reach a `127.0.0.1` agent — use the KVM host's LAN IP (split
  VMs) or `host.docker.internal` (same host).
- On plain HTTP keep `PROTEOS_COOKIE_SECURE=false`; put TLS in front for real use.
